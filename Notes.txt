- Create three folders inside src folder named components , data and utils.
- Now create a file music_courses.josn in data folder , and then copy paste content from the github repo.
- then create a file Navbar.tsx in components folder. And thn we'll add <Navbar /> in layout.tsx file to display on top of every page.
- Now in this project we'll learn how to use external libraries for components , we'll use Aceternity UI .

step-3 : similarly folow the instructions for components folder.

step-4 : Now since when we hover on navbar it gives the text a outline , active link property , which is the functionality of React , we have to use React. But Next
doesn't directly allow use of React functionalities , hence we'll add : " use client " on top of Navbar.tsx file.

step-5 ; Now we'll make our Navbar.tsx file with the help of the code given on website of navbar with our own adjutments.

step-6 : Add : darkmode : 'class' : in tailwind.config.js file for truly enabling dark mode. And also add : className ; "dark" : in layout.tsx file in app , in html.

step-7 : now here we're facing a issue that Home is giving a dropdown on hower despite not having any children , hence we have to modify coide and add a condition 
that is for dropdown there should exist their children in ui/navbar-menu.tsx line 41.

step-17 : then search for : Grid and Dot backgroundss , And then copy code from gist.github.com/hiteshchoudhary  and paste it in config.js , instead of method
given on website.

s√æep-18 : then create : UpcomingWebinars.tsx in comoponents and then search on ui website : card hover effect , then intigrate it.
